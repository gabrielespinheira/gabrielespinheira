## 👋  [Hey, I'm Gabriel Espinheira](https://gabs.app)

Hi there!

I’m a senior software engineer with a passion for technology and digital products. I first discovered my love for development while playing around with HTML and CSS when I was 16yo. I am dedicated to continuously improving my development skills, and am committed to producing high-quality, efficient and user-centric digital products. I take pride in my ability to understand business objectives and translate them into a seamless and intuitive user experience.

**I'm looking to build aesthetic software interfaces with focus on user experience with scalable architecture and design patterns. If you have a project that would be a good fit for my skills and experience, I would love to hear from you!**
