# [💯 Gabriel Espinheira](https://gabs.app)

Yoo! My name is **Gabriel Espinheira** and I'm a 28yo, **Carioca** (from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) who swapped Cristo Redentor for Pastéis de Nata, now **living in Lisbon**.

Fell in love with coding at 18yo and turned it into a career. Now, with **9 years of experience** under my belt as a **Senior Software Engineer**, I've crafted my skills in both **back-end** and **front-end**, always aiming for that perfect blend of form and function.

I believe in **creating digital products** that are not just functional, but visually appealing - because let's face it, **aesthetics** and **performance** go hand in hand!

Away from the keyboard, I dive into non-fiction books about design, finances, productivity, architecture, photography and geopolitics. With my camera as my constant companion, I love capturing the essence of my daily life and the adventures that travel brings.
